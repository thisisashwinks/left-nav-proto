 * Theme axes for the prototype.

 * Each axis maps to a data attribute that `src/design/tokens.css` keys off:

 *   appTheme    -> [data-app-theme]     on <html>
 *   navTheme    -> [data-nav-theme]     on the nav element
 *   headerTheme -> [data-header-theme]  on the header element
 *
 * `navTheme` is deliberately independent of `appTheme` so the nav can be dark
 * while the rest of the app stays light.
